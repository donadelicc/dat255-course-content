A: 
1. Computer Visions
2. Recommandations
3. NLP
4. Image generations
5. Playing games

Q: What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
A: Mark one Perceptron

Q: Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
A: BLANK

Q: What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
A: 
- A paper suggested that a single layer of artificial neurons cant learn simple mathamtical functions, while in the same paper they
demonstrated that additional layers can solve this problem. The first discovery was the one who was recognized.

Q: What is a GPU?
A: Graphic Processing Unit. 
    - With many cores it can do multiple calculations simultaniously (paralell processing)
    - Can process large blocks of data simultaniously (compared to CPU)


Q: Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?
A:
    - With variation i data there is impossible to write a program that is generalized
    - Hard to manually define rules
    - Hard to manually manage and interpret large amounts of data


Q: Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?
A: 
    - The model can find patterns that we humans cannot understand, beyound our logic
    - Its hard to understand why one node was adjusted
    - The dimansionaity and complexity of data makes it hard to understand for humans

Q: What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?
A: 
    - Universal Approximation Theorem

Q: What do you need in order to train a model?
A: 
    - You need a model architecture, like a neural network
    - You need a task
    - You need training, validation and test data.If you are doing supervised learning you need training data with labels
    - You need loss funciton, e.g. a way to check how the model is performing
    - You need a optimizer, e.g. a way to adjust parameters to minimize the loss
    - You need a metric, e.g. a way to evaluate the model on the spesific task

Q: How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?
A:
    - A feedback loop is when the output of a model is fed back into the model as input.
    
    
    1. If the initial data used to train the predictive policing model contains biases (e.g., higher crime reports in certain neighborhoods due to socio-economic factors or historical policing practices), the model may reinforce these biases.
    2. A feedback loop can cause police resources to be concentrated in areas highlighted by the model, neglecting other areas that may also need attention.
    3. Increased policing in predicted hotspots can lead to more arrests and crime reports in those areas, creating a feedback loop that distorts the underlying data.

Q:  Do we always have to use 224Ã—224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?
A:
    - No!


Q: What is the difference between classification and regression?
A:
    - Regression is prediction a continous value like price and temperature
    - Classification predict labels or categories like spam or not spam

Q: What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?
A:
    -  A validaiton set is used to calculate the models performance on the speisific task. 
        This set is used after every traning iteration. We need this to check whether our model is improving on the task at hand.

Q: What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?
A: 
    - They will automatically partition 20% av your dataset and set it aside. 

Q: Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?
A:
- No, We need to make sure that the validation set is representative of the data we are trying to predict. If we
 use a random sample, we may end up with a validation set that is not representative of the data, which can lead to
 inaccurate predictions.
 
Q:  What is overfitting? Provide an example.
A: 
 - Ovefitting occurs when a machine learning model becomes to complex for the underlying structure of the training data,
  resulting in poor performance on unseen data.  
    - The model can start to memorize training examples instead of generlizing patterns. This happens because the model becomes
        complex  and starts to learn trivial details that don't generalize well to new, unseen data.

Q: What is a metric? How does it differ from "loss"?
A:
    - A metric is used to evaluate the model's performance on the task its assigned
    - The "loss"is used to evaluate the models performance, predicted vs. actual.    

Q: How can pretrained models help?
A:
- **Transfer learning**: Using a pretrained model you can leverage knowlegde the model has gained from previous training and fine-tine it on your spesific task. This can save time, resource and improve performance.
- **Domain adaptation**: Using a pretrained model you can adapt it to a new domain. For example, if you have a model trained on images of 


Q: What is the "head" of a model?
A:
 - The final layers of the model that we change when fine-tuning a pretrained model. 

Q: What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?
A:
- The early layers typically learn:
    1. Local patterns: edges, lines and shapes within small regions of the image
    2. Texture features: smoothness and roughness of the imae
    3. Object bounderies    
 
- The later layers typically learn:
    1. Object parts: Subparts or components that make up an object, such as eyes, nose or wheels
    2. Contextual features: Relationships between objects, their positions and surrounding environment
    3. High-level abstractions: Object like shapes within spesific contexts


Q:  Are image models only useful for photos?
A:
- No, image models can be used for a wide range of image tasks, including:
    1. Object detection: Identifying and localizing objects in an image
    2. Semantic segmentation: Assigning a label to each pixel in an image
    3. Instance segmentation: Identifying and segmenting individual objects in an image
    4. Image classification: Predicting the class of an image
    5. Image generation: Generating new images based on a set of input images

Q:  What is an "architecture"?
A:
- The models structure or design. It's the blueprint that defines how the model processes input data,
 transforms it into meaningsfull representations, and ultimately makes predictions.
    - It typically consists of:
    1. An input layer
    2. Hidden layers 
    3. Output layers


Q: What is segmentation?
A:
- Assigning labels to pixels or objects in a an image

Q:  What is `y_range` used for? When do we need it?
A: 
- This is the possible outputs of the model -> e.g. the outputs of the output layer

Q: What are "hyperparameters"?
A: 
- Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a model, rather then parameters that beeing learned during traning.
    They control the model's architecture such as:
    1. number of layers and neurons
    2. learning rate
    3. optimizer
    4. batch size
